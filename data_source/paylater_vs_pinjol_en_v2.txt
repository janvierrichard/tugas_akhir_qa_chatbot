Recognize 7 Differences Paylater and Pinjol, what are they?
Learn the basic differences between paylater and pinjol, as well as wise tips for using them.
In the current digital era, many financial services make our daily transactions easier. Two of them that are currently on the rise are pinjol (online loans) and paylater (pay later).
Even though both offer convenience in transactions, there are basic differences that you need to know, you know.
What is Paylater and Pinjol?
Paylater, also known as "pay later", is now increasingly popular among the public, especially for those who often shop on e-commerce platforms or buy plane tickets on the marketplace.
As the name suggests, paylater allows users to finance the purchase of certain goods with payments that will be made later when they are due.
In other words, paylater is a service that makes it easier for people to buy a product or service by delaying payment or taking on debt.
However, the public is still obliged to pay off the debt according to the specified tenor.
Meanwhile, Pinjol or online loans are financial service institutions that offer cash loans to the public.
In contrast to paylater which can only be used to finance a purchase by postponing payment, pinjol provides cash funds that can be used for various purposes, both consumptive and productive needs.
One of the main advantages of Pinjol is its flexibility. Users can apply for loans with varying amounts, depending on their needs and loan repayment capabilities.
Apart from that, the tenor or duration of the loan can also be adjusted, ranging from a few days to several months.
In the world of lending, there are two main parties, namely the lender (lender) and the loan recipient (borrower). Lenders are individuals or institutions that provide funds to be lent, while loan recipients are those who borrow these funds to meet their various needs.
Difference between Paylater and Pinjol
After knowing the meaning of paylater and pinjol, here are the main differences between the two as reported by Kompas and CNN.
1. Transaction method
When talking about pinjol and paylater, we often think of them as the same. However, there are actually fundamental differences in how they work. Paylater, as the name suggests, allows you to finance a purchase, such as goods, by paying the bill with interest when it is due with a payment duration that you can choose, starting from 1, 3, 6, or 12 months.
Meanwhile, Pinjol is a platform that offers instant loans that you can pay back when due. So, if you need cash quickly, Pinjol could be the solution.
2. Rules regarding loans and paylaters
In the world of digital finance, regulation is one of the most important things to protect consumers. Pinjol, which is also known as Information Technology-Based Joint Funding Services (LPBBTI), is regulated by the Financial Services Authority (OJK).
The rules are based on OJK Regulation (POJK) Number 10/POJK.05/20221. This shows that Pinjol has certain standards that must be met by its organizers.
On the other hand, even though it has the potential to facilitate transactions, paylater applications can also pose risks, especially if they are not supervised by authorities or other financial institutions. However, several paylater applications have now also been registered with the OJK.
3. Type of company
There are basic differences between companies that offer loans and paylaters. According to Eddy Junarsin, an economist from UGM, the companies that provide this service are different.
Paylater may look similar to fintech peer-to-peer (P2P) lending or what we know as online loans (pinjol). However, actually the two are clearly different.
Fintech companies are companies that provide financial transaction services using technological advances in them, and make online loan systems one of their services.
On the other hand, companies that implement paylater systems are not necessarily fintech companies. As previously mentioned, the majority of companies providing paylater features are e-commerce which usually collaborate with fintech or banking companies as loan providers.
4. Intended use
One of the basic differences between pinjol and paylater is the purpose of their use. Paylater is usually provided by e-commerce or marketplaces to make it easier for customers to make transactions for certain purchases.
For example, when you want to buy necessities or travel tickets, you can choose the paylater option to postpone payment until the maturity date.
Meanwhile, Pinjol is a non-bank financing institution that the public can access online through various applications.
Unlike Paylater which is usually integrated with e-commerce, the Pinjol application can be accessed independently. This allows people to borrow money without having to transact on a marketplace.
5. Security level
Security is one of the important aspects to pay attention to when choosing financial services. Paylater is considered safer because its services come from trusted financing institutions such as banks or multi-finance companies.
On the other hand, even though there are loans that are registered and under the supervision of the OJK, many illegal or fraudulent loans are still found. The existence of this illegal pinjol is considered like a weed that is difficult to eradicate and can pose a risk to its users.
6. Loan interest
Both of these services, both paylater and pinjol, provide interest to borrowers. However, it should be noted that the interest rates given can vary depending on the service provider.
Therefore, it is important for you to compare and choose the service that offers the lowest interest.
7. Loan proceeds
In terms of the fund distribution process, paylater involves many parties, including borrowers, loan provider companies, e-commerce, and merchants.
Meanwhile, borrowing only involves two parties, namely the company providing the funds and the borrower. Usually, the borrower will apply for credit through an application and once approved, the funds will be sent to the borrower's account for disbursement.
Wise Tips for Using Paylater and Pinjol
So, before you decide to use paylater or pinjol, as reported by CNBC, it's a good idea for you to consider the following things.
1. Consider ability to pay
Before using paylater or loan services, make sure that the total installments do not exceed 30% of your total monthly income to avoid excessive financial burdens.
2. Use it for needs, not wants
Use this service to meet urgent needs or profitable investments, not to fulfill consumer desires which can increase your financial burden.
3. Check the legality of the company
Before deciding to use a loan service, always check the legality of the organizing company at the OJK to avoid fraud and inhuman interest.
4. Pay attention to details of fees and interest
Apart from that, before deciding whether to use a loan or paylater, check the details of the fees and interest rates offered by the provider. This helps you to avoid bad surprises later.
5. Pay off the installments immediately
If possible, pay off the pay later installments as soon as possible to avoid accumulating interest charges.
6. Use services with safe limits
Avoid having many paylater accounts or using this service beyond the specified limit to control expenses and prevent installment burdens that exceed financial capabilities.
7. Read the detailed requirements
Before taking out a loan, carefully read the terms provided by the service provider. This is necessary to minimize misunderstanding regarding the rights and obligations of both parties.
In the world of digital finance, understanding the difference between pinjol and paylater is very important. Even though both offer convenience in transactions, make sure not to exceed the maximum installment of 30% and your ability to pay.

What happens if I don't pay on time?
If you don't pay on time, here are several things that might happen to your GoPay Later:
You will receive payment reminders through several channels; SMS, email or call
If you are in arrears beyond a certain number of days, your GoPay Later account may be blocked and may even be blocked permanently. If you are permanently blocked, you can no longer pay.
Because we send daily reports of your GoPay Later account to the Fintech Data Center (FDC) and credit bureau services regarding your arrears status, this may ultimately affect your credit rating on other fintech lending platforms.
How to pay it off early?
By paying off early, you will get several benefits such as:
- No early repayment fees
- Discount on all future installment interest
Reduce bill payments because you will only pay the remaining balance in the following month.
There are two scenarios you can follow when making an early payment:
Scenario 1: If you have a due date this month (your transaction is between 1-15), you must pay off the current month's installments first, then you will be able to see the early repayment feature.
Scenario 2: If you have a due date in the following month (your transaction is between 16 - 30/31), you can immediately see the early repayment menu.
